                        <p class="text__a">While players were making considerable salaries playing professionally, in the six-figures, a lot of players still needed to supplement their rugby with a regular profession.</p>
                        <p class="text__a">Some of the favourites included lorry driver and Scotland scrum-half, Gary Armstrong, or RAF pilot from England, Rory Underwood and even Piano Mover, Samoan prop Peter Fatialofa.</p>

                                           But it is for safety and well being of players (short and long term) as well as the betterment of the game.</p>

                        <p class="text__c">With the increased size and weight requirements of today's rugby professions, especially the forwards, there's a big ephasis on player safety and with that comes increased safety in the scrums.
